# Overview
This is a R package to compute the autimorphisms between pairwise aligned DNA
sequences represented as elements from a Genomic Abelian group as described in
reference ([1](#1)). In a general scenario, whole chromosomes or genomic regions
from a population (from any species or close related species) can be
algebraically represented as a direct sum of cyclic groups or more specifically
Abelian *p*-groups. Basically, we propose the representation of multiple
sequence alignments (MSA) of length _N_ as a finite Abelian group created by the
direct sum of homocyclic Abelian groups of _prime-power order_:


$$
\qquad G = (\mathbb{Z}_{p^{\alpha_{1}}_1})^{n_1} \oplus (\mathbb{Z}_{p^{\alpha_{2}}_1})^{n_2} \oplus \dots \oplus (\mathbb{Z}_{p^{\alpha_{k}}_k})^{n_k} 
$$

Where, the $p_i$'s are prime numbers, $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{N}$ and 
$\mathbb{Z}_{p^{\alpha_{i}}_i}$ is the group of integer modulo 
$p^{\alpha_{i}}_i$. 

For the purpose of estimating the automorphism between two aligned DNA
sequences, $p^{\alpha_{i}}_i \in \{5, 2^6, 5^3 \}$.

## Automorphisms

Herein, automorphisms are considered algebraic descriptions of mutational event
observed in codon sequences represented on different Abelian groups. In
particular, as described in references ([3-4](#3)), for each representation of
the codon set on a defined Abelian group there are 24 possible isomorphic
Abelian groups. These Abelian groups can be labeled based on the DNA base-order
used to generate them. The set of 24 Abelian groups can be described as a group
isomorphic to the symmetric group of degree four ($S_4$, see reference
([4](#4))).

For further support about the symmetric group on the 24 Abelian group of 
genetic-code cubes, users can also see [Symmetric Group of the Genetic-Code Cubes.](https://github.com/genomaths/GenomeAlgebra_SymmetricGroup), 
specifically the Mathematica notebook 
_IntroductionToZ5GeneticCodeVectorSpace.nb_ and interact with it using
Wolfram Player, freely available (for Windows and Linux OS) at,
<https://www.wolfram.com/player/>.


# Automorphisms on $\mathbb{Z}_{64}$

First, we proceed to load the R package required for our analysis
```{r library, message=FALSE}
library(GenomAutomorphism)
library(Biostrings)
library(ggseqlogo)
```

Next, we proceed to check the DNA multiple sequence alignment (MSA) file. This
ia a FASTA file carrying the MSA of mammals (somatic) Cystocrome c. Notice that
we are familiar with the _FASTA_ file, then it is better to directly read it
with function 
[automorphisms](https://genomaths.github.io/genomautomorphism/reference/automorphism.html).

However, for the current example, this step can be bypassed, since the 
MSA is provided provided together with _*GenomAutomorphism*_ R package 

```{r fasta, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Do not run it. This is included with package
URL <- paste0("https://github.com/genomaths/seqalignments/raw/master/CYCS/",
              "primate_cytochrome_c_(CYCS)_18_sequences.fasta")

cyc_aln <- readDNAMultipleAlignment(filepath = URL)
```

Load MSA available in the package
```{r dat}
data("cyc_aln")
cyc_aln
```

The sequence names
```{r names}
strtrim(rownames(cyc_aln), 100)
```

The corresponding aminoacid sequence is:
```{r trans}
translate(cyc_aln@unmasked)
```

Next, function [automorphisms](https://genomaths.github.io/genomautomorphism/reference/automorphism.html)
will be applied to represent the codon sequence in
the Abelian group $\mathbb{Z}_{64}$ (i.e., the set of integers remainder modulo
64). The codon coordinates are requested on the cube ACGT. Following reference
([4](#4))), cubes are labeled based on the order of DNA bases used to define the
sum operation.

In Z64, automorphisms are described as functions $f(x) = k\,x \quad mod\,64$,
where $k$ and $x$ are elements from the set of integers modulo 64. Below, in
function [automorphisms](https://genomaths.github.io/genomautomorphism/reference/automorphism.html)
three important arguments are given values: _group =
"Z64"_, _cube = c("ACGT", "TGCA")_, and _cube_alt = c("CATG", "GTAC")_. Setting
for group specifies on which group the automorphisms will be computed. These
groups can be: "Z5", "Z64", "Z125", and "Z5^3".

In groups "Z64" and "Z125" not all the mutational events can be described as
automorphisms from a given cube. So, a character string denoting pairs of "dual"
the genetic-code cubes, as given in references ([1-4](#2))), is given as
argument for _cube_. That is, the base pairs from the given cubes must be
complementary each other. Such a cube pair are call dual cubes and, as shown in
reference ([4](#4))), each pair integrates group. If automorphisms are not found
in first set of dual cubes, then the algorithm search for automorphism in a
alternative set of dual cubes.


```{r url, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Do not run it. This is included with package

nams <- c("human_1", "human_2", "gorilla", "human_3", "human_4",
          "human_5", "human_6", "silvery_gibbon", "white_cheeked_gibbon",
          "franÃ§ois_langur", "olive_baboon_1", "olive_baboon_2",
          "golden_monkey", "rhesus_monkeys_1", "rhesus_monkeys_2",
          "gelada_baboon_1", "gelada_baboon_2", "orangutan_1", "orangutan_2")

cyc_autm <- automorphisms(filepath = URL, 
                      group = "Z64", 
                      cube = c("ACGT", "TGCA"),
                      cube_alt = c("CATG", "GTAC"),
                      nms = nams,
                      verbose = FALSE)
```

Object *autm* is included with package and can be load typing:
```{r cyc_autm}
data(cyc_autm, package = "GenomAutomorphism")
cyc_autm
```

An AutomorphismList class object is returned. The codon sequences (_seq1_ and
_seq2_) with their corresponding coordinates (left) are returned, as well as the
coordinated representation on $\mathbb{Z}_{64}$ (_coord1_ and _coord2_). Observe
that two new columns were added, the automorphism coefficient $k$ (named as
_autm_) and the genetic-code cube where the automorphism was found. By
convention the DNA sequence is given for the positive strand. Since the _dual
cube_ of **"ACGT"** corresponds to the complementary base order **TGCA**,
automorphisms described by the cube **TGCA** represent mutational events
affecting the DNA negative strand (-).

## Bar plot automorphism distribution by cubes
The automorphism distribution by cubes can be summarized in the bar-plot graphic

```{r barplot, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 4.5}
counts <- table(unlist(lapply(cyc_autm@DataList, 
            function(x) {
              x = data.frame(x)
              x =  x[ x$autm != 1 | is.na(x$autm), ]
              return(x$cube)}
            )
        ))

par(family = "serif", cex = 0.8, font = 2, mar = c(4,6,4,4))
barplot(counts, #main="Automorphism distribution",
        xlab="Genetic-code cube representation",
        ylab="Fixed mutational events",
col=c("darkblue","red", "darkgreen", "magenta", "orange"), 
        border = NA, axes = FALSE, ylim = c(0,300),
        cex.lab = 2, cex.main = 1.5, cex.names = 2)
axis(2, at = c(0, 100, 200, 300), cex.axis = 1.5)
mtext(side = 1,line = -1.5, at = c(0.7, 1.9),
      text = paste0( counts ), cex = 1.4,
      col = c("white","yellow"))
```

## Bar plot automorphism distribution by regions

The last result can be summarized by gene regions as follow:
```{r range}
autm_range <- automorphismByRanges(cyc_autm, 
                                  min.len = 2, 
                                  verbose = FALSE)
autm_range
```


That is, function _automorphismByRanges_ permits the classification
of the pairwise alignment of protein-coding sub-regions based on the
mutational events observed on it quantitatively represented as automorphisms on 
genetic-code cubes.

Searching for automorphisms on $\mathbb{Z}_{64}$ permits us a quantitative
differentiation between mutational events at different codon positions from a
given DNA protein-encoding region. As shown in reference ([4](#4))) a set of
different cubes can be applied to describe the best evolutionary aminoacid scale
highly correlated with aminoacid physicochemical properties describing the
observed evolutionary process in a given protein.

More information about this subject can be found in the supporting material from
reference ([4](#4))) at GitHub
[GenomeAlgebra_SymmetricGroup](https://github.com/genomaths/GenomeAlgebra_SymmetricGroup),
particularly by interacting with the Mathematica notebook
[Genetic-Code-Scales_of_Amino-Acids.nb](https://github.com/genomaths/GenomeAlgebra_SymmetricGroup/blob/master/Genetic-Code-Scales_of_Amino-Acids.nb).


The automorphism distribution by cubes can be summarized in the bar-plot graphic

```{r barplot1, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 3}
cts <- unlist(autm_range)
counts <- table(cts$cube)

par(family = "serif", cex = 0.6, font = 2, las = 1)
barplot(counts, main="Automorphism distribution",
        xlab="Genetic-code cube representation",
        col=c("darkblue","red", "darkgreen"), 
        border = NA, axes = T)
mtext(side = 1,line = -6, at = c(0.7, 1.9, 3.1),
      text = paste0( counts ), cex = 1.4,
      col = c("white","yellow"))

```

## Grouping automorphism by automorphism's coefficients
Automorphisms with the same automorphism's coefficients can be grouped.

```{r autby}
autby_coef <- automorphism_bycoef(cyc_autm, 
                                 verbose = FALSE)
autby_coef
```


Every single base mutational event across the MSA was classified according IUPAC
nomenclature: 1) According to the number of hydrogen bonds (on DNA/RNA
double helix): strong S={C, G} (three hydrogen bonds) and weak W={A, U} (two
hydrogen bonds). According to the chemical type: purines R={A, G} and
pyrimidines Y={C, U}. 3). According to the presence of amino or keto groups on
the base rings: amino M={C, A} and keto K={G, T}.  Constant (hold) base
positions were labeled with letter H. So, codon positions labeled as HKH means
that the first and third bases remains constant and mutational events between
bases G and T were found in the MSA.

```{r barplot_2, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
cts <- unlist(autby_coef)
counts <- table(cts$mut_type[ cts$autm != 1 & cts$autm != -1 ])
counts <- sort(counts, decreasing = TRUE)

par(family = "serif", cex.axis = 1.4, font = 2, las = 1, 
    cex.main = 1.4, cex.lab = 2)
barplot(counts, main="Automorphism distribution per Mutation type",
        col = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "dodgerblue"), 
        border = NA, axes = TRUE,las=2)
mtext(side = 1,line = -2, at = c(0.7, 1.9, 3.1, 4.3, 5.5),
      text = paste0( counts ), cex = 1.4,
      col = c("white", "red", "blue", "black", "yellow"))
```


## Bar plot automorphism distribution by cubes
The automorphism distribution by cubes can be summarized in the bar-plot graphic.

Object *autby_coef* carried all the pairwise comparisons, while it will be
enough to use data from a single species as reference, e.g., humans.

First the data must be reordered into a \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} object:
```{r dat1}
hautby_coef <- autby_coef[ grep("human", names(autby_coef)) ]
h_autby_coef <- unlist(hautby_coef)
h_autby_coef <- h_autby_coef[ which(h_autby_coef$autm != 1) ]

nams <- names(h_autby_coef)
nams <- sub("human[_][1-6][.]", "", nams)
nams <- sub("[_][1-6]", "", nams)

dt <- data.frame(h_autby_coef, species = nams)
dt <- dt[, c("start", "autm", "species", "cube")]
```


Nominal variables are transformed into \code{\link[base]{factor}}
```{r as.factor}
dt$start <- as.numeric(dt$start)
dt$autm <- as.numeric(dt$autm)
dt$cube <- as.factor(dt$cube)
dt$species <- as.factor(dt$species)
DataFrame(dt)
```


```{r barplot2, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 4}
counts <- table(dt$cube)

par(family = "serif", cex = 0.6, font = 2, mar=c(4,6,4,4))
barplot(counts, #main="Automorphism distribution",
        xlab="Genetic-code cube representation",
        ylab="Fixed mutational events",
        col=c("darkblue","red", "darkgreen", "magenta", "orange"), 
        border = NA, axes = F, #ylim = c(0, 6000),
        cex.lab = 2, cex.main = 1.5, cex.names = 2)
axis(2, at = c(0, 50, 100, 150, 200), cex.axis = 1.5)
mtext(side = 1,line = -2.5, at = c(0.7, 1.9, 3.1, 4.3, 5.5),
      text = paste0( counts ), cex = 1.4,
      col = c("white", "yellow"))
```


## Conserved and non-conserved regions 

A specific function is provided to get the coordinates of conserved and 
non-conserved regions, which can be used in further downstream analyses.

The conserved regions from each pairwise comparison are retrieved typing: 
```{r conserv}
conserved_regions(x = autby_coef)
```


The non-conserved regions from each pairwise comparison are obtained with
the same function but different settings:
```{r nonconsv}
ncs <- conserved_regions(x = autby_coef, conserved = FALSE)
ncs
```

# Subsetting regions of interest
The application of some of the available bioinformatic tools is straightforward.
For example, knowing the positions for the conserved and non-conserved regions,
we can subset into the alignment region of potential interest. 

The coordinates carrying mutational events are:
```{r mut}
sort(unique(start(ncs)))
```

We will use function 
[DNAStringSet](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Biostrings/versions/2.40.2/topics/XStringSet-class)
from the Bioconductor R package [Biostrings](https://kasperdanielhansen.github.io/genbioconductor/html/Biostrings.html) 
to subset the MSA of primate cytochrome c. 

```{r dna_region}
cyc_aln_region <- DNAStringSet(cyc_aln, start = 37*3 - 2, end = 42*3)
cyc_aln_region
```


Next, function [ggseqlogo](https://rdrr.io/cran/ggseqlogo/man/ggseqlogo.html)
from the R package [ggseqlogo](https://rdrr.io/cran/ggseqlogo/) will be applied 
to get the logo sequence from the selected MSA region. 
```{r seqlogo, message=FALSE}
ggseqlogo( as.character(cyc_aln_region) )
```

The corresponding aminoacid sequence will be

```{r aa}
cyc_aln_region_aa = translate(cyc_aln_region)
cyc_aln_region_aa
```

And the corresponding aminoacid sequence logo will is
```{r aa_logo, message=FALSE}
ggseqlogo( as.character(cyc_aln_region_aa) )
```

That is, the first mutational event reported in the codon sequence correspond to
a synonymous mutation.

Alternatively, we can start translating the DNA MSA. 

```{r trasnl}
cyc_aln_aa <- translate(cyc_aln@unmasked)
cyc_aln_aa
```


```{r subs}
cyc_aln_aa_region <- AAStringSet(cyc_aln_aa, start = 37, end = 42)
cyc_aln_aa_region
```


```{r seqlogo_aa}
ggseqlogo( as.character(cyc_aln_aa_region) )
```
